## Mixed-Messages

### Objective

This project was provided to me by codecademy. The objective is to create a program that produces a different message 
each time its loaded. To accomplish this, I used JSON to create an API call to ZenQuotes Premium to get one 
randomized insperational quote and the author's name each time called.

#### Current progress

+ Created one html document with Javascript
+ Created JSON module
+ Obtained data from "zenquotes.io/api/random/[your_key]" via 'Fetch'
+ Parse to JSON object literal
+ Obtain nested element and print to screen
