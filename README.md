# Mixed-Messages

## Objective

In this project provided by CodeCademy I will create a program that returns a different message each time it is opened. 
For my version of this project my program will return a new insperational message each time it is loaded. I also hope to 
have my program produce a new relaxing background image each time the page is loaded as well.

## Current progress

So far I have created a .mjs file that makes a web API call to ZenQuotes Premium. Here is the url for the web documents: 
(https://premium.zenquotes.io/zenquotes-documentation/)

I also started work on an html doc that will post the results to the web for viewing.
